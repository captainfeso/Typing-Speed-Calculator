In more modern times, pharmacists advise patients and health care providers on the selection, dosages, interactions, and side effects of medications, and act as a learned intermediary between a prescriber and a patient. Pharmacists monitor the health and progress of patients to ensure the safe and effective use of medication. Pharmacists may practice compounding; however, many medicines are now produced by pharmaceutical companies in a standard dosage and drug delivery form. In some jurisdictions, pharmacists have prescriptive authority to either independently prescribe under their own authority or in collaboration with a primary care physician through an agreed upon protocol.\",\n    \"A freelancer or freelance worker, is a term commonly used for a person who is self-employed and is not necessarily committed to a particular employer long-term. Freelance workers are sometimes represented by a company or a temporary agency that resells freelance labor to clients; others work independently or use professional associations or websites to get work. While the term 'independent contractor' would be used in a higher register of English to designate the tax and employment classes of this type of worker, the term freelancing is most common in culture and creative industries and this term specifically motions to participation therein. Fields, professions, and industries where freelancing is predominant include: music, writing, acting, computer programming, web design, graphic design, translating and illustrating, film and video production and other forms of piece work which some cultural theorists consider as central to the cognitive-cultural economy.\",\n    \"Income before securities transactions was up 10.8 percent from $13.49 million in 1982 to $14.95 million in 1983. Earnings per share (adjusted for a 10.5 percent stock dividend distributed on August 26) advanced 10 percent to $2.39 in 1983 from $2.17 in 1982. Earnings may rise for 7 years. Hopefully, earnings per share will grow another 10 percent. Kosy, Klemin, and Bille began selling on May 23, 1964. Their second store was founded in Renton on August 3, 1965.

The role of these emotions varies. Some of them are useful while others may be harmful. The use of social media for self-expression has reached a point that it makes us feel we can say anything. This begins when we see people expressing anything and everything that come to mind. When we see everyone else voicing their likes and dislikes, their irritations and desires we tend to imitate what they do. And because many engage in this, we think that it is normal and healthy. However, when we get used to unbridled self-expression, we come to believe that all feelings are valid. We become convinced that in real life, we should also act on our emotions and our impulses. Using social media this way erodes our ability to regulate our actions and reactions. To illustrate, when something small irritates us we think that it's okay to feel this way. But isn't it better to foster one's patience and resilience instead of immediately complaining? Or when we develop an attraction to someone despite that person being in a relationship, and because social media has conditioned us that all feelings can be expressed, we tend to think that acting on this attraction is okay. Not all feelings deserve expression. We find ourselves creating our own problems when we let our present emotions control our actions.\",\n    \"Today, historians relate that, as a general rule, buying and selling securities was very much unorganized before the year 1792. Every person who owned a security faced the problem of finding interested buyers who might consider the purchase of a debt-free investment. This meant most people were somewhat slow in investing in stocks and bonds because these securities could not readily be converted into money. We have been told that an interesting number of traders and merchants agreed to try to do something to help correct the situation. At this first crucial meeting, they decided that it was a good idea to visit regularly on a daily basis to buy and sell securities. The group of leaders, whose meeting place was under an old, tall cottonwood tree, found the needed time to plot the financial future of our nation. We know from reading the old records that the original team who met together long ago in May became the very first members of the New York Stock Exchange. The New York Stock Exchange is still operating. Other stock exchanges conduct business in many countries around the world. Thousands and thousands of stocks and bonds are bought and sold each day.\",\n    \"Being human makes us susceptible to the onset of feelings. The role of these emotions varies.

Orville and Wilbur Wright started building gliders in 1900. In 1903, they built a motor and propeller for their glider. Orville made the first flight, which lasted 12 seconds, and flew 120 feet. Wilbur's flight was 852 feet in 59 seconds. These first flights in 1903 were just the start of the evolution of planes. By the year 1909, Bleriot had crossed the English Channel. By the year 1912, a two-piece plywood fuselage was built for greater strength. By the 1930s, the all-metal fuselage was tried, and it soon appeared in DC3s. From the Wrights' 1903 motor and prop came the engines for the 1950 turbojet that generated at least 19,600 pounds of thrust. The big Boeing 747 has four engines with 50,000 pounds of thrust each. The future holds an advanced super-sonic jet with a saving of almost 40 percent in fuel usage.\",\n    \"Frank Edward McGurrin, a court stenographer from Salt Lake City, Utah who taught typing classes, reportedly invented touch typing in 1888. On a standard keyboard for English speakers the home row keys are: 'ASDF' for the left hand and 'JKL;' for the right hand. The keyboard is called a QWERTY keyboard because these are the first six letters on the keyboard. Most modern computer keyboards have a raised dot or bar on the home keys for the index fingers to help touch typists maintain and rediscover the correct position on the keyboard quickly with no need to look at the keys. More recently, the ability to touch type on touchscreen phones has been made possible with the use of specialized virtual keyboard software for touch typing.\",\n    \"Self-confidence is a tricky subject for many people. For some, it's impossible to feel good about themselves without outside validation. When you're in a situation where the people in your life aren't helping you to feel better about yourself, this can become a problem in your day to day life. Most insecurity stems from feelings of not being attractive or feelings of loneliness. If your insecurity doesn't necessarily stem from a lack of interaction, but more a lack of feeling attractive, there are other options that will help you online. Sometimes the best way to put your insecurities to rest can simply be to get an honest opinion. There are multiple support groups online where you can share a picture of yourself with other members and they will give honest feedback on your appearance. In most cases, they will point out good qualities that you may have missed in yourself. But you can trust them to be honest and many members give very valuable style and posture advice to increase your attractiveness. These practical tips and unbiased opinions from supportive strangers will immediately help you feel better about yourself, and if the tips are implemented it will also improve your self-esteem in the long-run.\"\n];","export const testDetailsCalculator = (originalValue, typedValue) => {\n    const words = typedValue.split(' ').length;\n    const characters = typedValue.length;\n    const mistakes = typedValue.split('').reduce((acc, typedChar, index) => {\n        return typedChar !== originalValue[index] ? acc+1 : acc \n    }, 0)\n\n    return { words, characters, mistakes }\n}","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './components/App/App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
